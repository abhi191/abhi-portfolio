# Section 1: Introduction & the problem

This is a standard paragraph block. You can write as much as you need here. The system will automatically create paragraphs based on empty lines, just like in standard Markdown.

This is another paragraph, separated by a blank line above. It explains the core user problem we set out to solve. You can highlight text for emphasis! Use `==text==` for a yellow highlight, or `==color:text==` for a specific color (e.g., `==red:important==`).
# You can define your own custom colors! See the instructions in README.md or edit the tailwind.config in index.html.

> This is a quote block. Use it for user feedback or important statements.
> -- Optional Author

# Section 4: Complex layouts

Use a two-column layout to place text and images side-by-side.

[TWO_COLUMNS]
[LEFT]
This is the content for the left column. You can have multiple paragraphs or other simple blocks here.

It's great for explaining a concept next to a visual.
