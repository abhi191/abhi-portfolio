# Your Personal Portfolio Website - A Simple Guide

Hello! This is a guide to help you understand and easily update your personal portfolio website. You don't need to be a professional coder to make changes. Think of this as your website's instruction manual!

---

## 1. What is this project?

This is the code for your beautiful, minimalist portfolio website. It's built to be simple and clean. It has three main views:

1.  **Homepage:** Where you introduce yourself and showcase your featured work.
2.  **About Me Page:** A dedicated space to share your story, experience, and personality.
3.  **Project Detail Page:** A full case study page for each of your projects, which can be individually password-protected.

## 2. Where are all the files? (The Website's Filing Cabinet)

All the website's files are organized to be as clear as possible. Hereâ€™s a quick tour:

-   `README.md`
    -   You're reading it right now! It's the main guide.

-   `index.html`
    -   Think of this as the main "frame" or "skeleton" of your website. We use it to set up important things like **colors, fonts, and custom animations**.

-   `App.tsx`
    -   This file is the "traffic cop." It decides which page to show the visitor and handles the logic for displaying the password prompt.
    
-   `data/` (folder)
    -   This folder holds all your content.
    -   `types.ts`: This important file defines the "blueprint" or structure for a project (what fields it has, like `title`, `description`, etc.).
    -   `projects/` (folder): **This is where all your project files live!** Each project has its own file here.
        -   `1-google-ecommerce.ts`: An example project file.
        -   `index.ts`: This file gathers all your individual projects and puts them in a list for the website to display.

-   `components/` (folder)
    -   This folder contains all the reusable "building blocks" of your website.

    -   `Header.tsx`: The navigation bar at the very top of your site.
    -   `Footer.tsx`: The section at the very bottom with your social media links.
    -   `Hero.tsx`: The big, welcoming intro section on the homepage.
    -   `FeaturedSection.tsx`: The list of project cards on the homepage.
    -   `ProjectPage.tsx`: The template that displays your detailed case study.
    -   `AboutPage.tsx`: The *entire* "About Me" page is inside this one file.
    -   `PasswordPrompt.tsx`: The pop-up that asks for a password.
    -   `icons.tsx`: This file holds the code for the small icons used on the site.

## 3. How to Make Changes (The Fun Part!)

### A. How to Add or Edit a Project

Your portfolio is now set up so that each project is its own separate file. This makes it super clean and easy to manage.

#### Step 1: Create a New Project File
1.  Go to the `data/projects/` folder.
2.  To create a new project, the easiest way is to **duplicate an existing project file** (like `1-google-ecommerce.ts`).
3.  Rename your new file. It's good practice to start the filename with a number to help with ordering (e.g., `4-my-new-project.ts`).

#### Step 2: Edit Your Project's Content
1.  Open your new project file. You'll see a structure with fields like `id`, `title`, `description`, etc. **Carefully edit the content for each field.**
2.  Make sure the `id` is a **unique number** that no other project uses.
3.  Fill out the top-level details like `title`, `description`, `role`, `timeline`, and the `metrics` for the homepage card.

#### Step 3: Add Your New Project to the Main List
1.  Now, open the file `data/projects/index.ts`. This file controls which projects appear on your site and in what order.
2.  At the top of the file, **import your new project**.
    ```javascript
    // Add this line at the top with the other imports
    import { myNewProject } from './4-my-new-project'; 
    ```
3.  Finally, add your new project to the `projects` array. The order of projects in this array is the order they will appear on your homepage.
    ```javascript
    export const projects: Project[] = [
      googleEcommerceProject,
      vmwareDashboardProject,
      oracleHealthcareProject,
      myNewProject, // <-- Add your new project here
    ];
    ```
That's it! Your new project will now appear on your website.

### B. Editing a Project's Case Study Page

This is where you have the most creative control! The case study page is built from a series of flexible content blocks.

In your project file (e.g., `4-my-new-project.ts`), all the content for the case study lives inside the `sections` array. A `section` is just a headline followed by a series of content blocks.

**The basic structure looks like this:**

```javascript
sections: [
  {
    title: 'The First Section Headline',
    blocks: [
      // ... content blocks go here ...
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'The Second Section Headline',
    blocks: [
      // ... more content blocks go here ...
    ]
  }
]
```

To build your case study, you simply add different types of blocks to the `blocks` array for each section.

**Pro Tip:** Open the file `data/projects/1-google-ecommerce.ts`. It contains an example of every single content block described below. You can copy and paste the code for any block you want to use!

---

#### Content Block Types You Can Use:

**1. Paragraph**
For any standard text. Add a new block for each new paragraph.

*Code Example:*
```javascript
{ 
  type: 'paragraph', 
  content: 'This is the text for my paragraph. It can be as long as I want it to be.' 
}
```

**2. Lists (Bulleted or Numbered)**
Perfect for project goals, key learnings, or any list of items.

*Code Example (Bulleted):*
```javascript
{ 
  type: 'list', 
  style: 'unordered', // or 'ordered' for a numbered list
  items: [
    "First list item.",
    "Second list item.",
    "Third list item."
  ]
}
```

**3. Image with Optional Caption**
To display a standard, centered image. You can optionally make it "expandable," meaning a user can click it to see it in a full-screen view.

*Code Example:*
```javascript
{ 
  type: 'image', 
  src: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557804506-669a67965ba0', // URL for the image
  caption: 'This is an optional caption for the image.',
  isExpandable: true // Add this line to make the image clickable!
}
```

**4. Full-Width Image**
Perfect for high-impact mockups. This block breaks out of the text container to span a much wider area. It can also be made expandable.

*Code Example:*
```javascript
{ 
  type: 'fullWidthImage', 
  src: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512499617640-c74ae3a79d37',
  caption: 'This is an optional caption for the full-width image.',
  isExpandable: true // Make it clickable!
}
```

**5. Image Carousel**
An interactive slideshow. **Images in a carousel are always expandable** into a full-screen lightbox view by default.

*Code Example:*
```javascript
{ 
  type: 'carousel', 
  slides: [
    { 
      src: 'https://...image-url-1.com', 
      caption: 'Slide 1: This is the first caption.' 
    },
    { 
      src: 'https://...image-url-2.com', 
      caption: 'Slide 2: A different caption.' 
    },
    { 
      src: 'https://...image-url-3.com' // Caption is optional
    }
  ]
}
```

**6. Quote**
Perfect for highlighting user testimonials, stakeholder feedback, or key pull quotes.

*Code Example:*
```javascript
{ 
  type: 'quote', 
  text: 'This new design has transformed our workflow and saved us hours every week.',
  author: 'John Smith, Project Stakeholder' // Author is optional
}
```

**7. Two-Column Layout**
A powerful way to place content side-by-side. Each column can contain any other block type (like paragraphs or an image).

*Code Example:*
```javascript
{ 
  type: 'twoColumn', 
  columns: [
    { // Left Column
      blocks: [
        { type: 'paragraph', content: 'This text will appear in the left column.' },
        { type: 'paragraph', content: 'You can add multiple blocks here.' }
      ]
    },
    { // Right Column
      blocks: [
        { type: 'image', src: 'https://...your-image-url.com' }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**8. Metric Cards**
Great for showcasing the final results and impact of your project in a visually appealing way.

*Code Example:*
```javascript
{ 
  type: 'metricCards', 
  metrics: [
    { value: '+40%', label: 'Increase in Conversion Rate' },
    { value: '-25%', label: 'Reduction in Cart Abandonment' },
    { value: '+85%', label: 'Growth in Mobile Revenue' },
  ]
}
```

**9. Table**
Use this for structured data, like a competitive analysis.

*Code Example:*
```javascript
{ 
  type: 'table', 
  headers: ['Feature', 'Competitor A', 'Competitor B', 'Our Solution'], 
  rows: [
    ['Guest Checkout', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes (Streamlined)'],
    ['Mobile Performance', 'Good', 'Average', 'Excellent'],
    ['Return Process', 'Complex', 'Easy', 'One-click returns']
  ]
}
```

### C. Setting Project Passwords

You can set a unique password for each project.

1.  Open the specific project's file (e.g., `data/projects/1-google-ecommerce.ts`).
2.  Add a `password` property to it, right after the `id`.
    ```javascript
    export const myProject: Project = {
      id: 4,
      password: 'my-secret-password-123',
      // ... rest of the project data
    };
    ```
3.  To make a project public, simply make sure it **does not** have a `password` property.

### D. Updating Project Company & Logos

Each project card can display a "chip" with the company's logo and name.

#### Method 1: Linking to an SVG File (Recommended)
1.  Create a `logos` folder in your project's main directory.
2.  Add your SVG file (e.g., `new-company.svg`) to this folder.
3.  In your project file, update the `companyLogoUrl` to the path of your file.
    ```javascript
    companyLogoUrl: '/logos/new-company.svg', // <-- Update this path
    ```

#### Method 2: Embedding the SVG as a Data URI (Advanced)
This is useful for small icons. You can use an online "SVG to data URI encoder" to convert your SVG code into a long string and paste it as the `companyLogoUrl`.

### E. Changing Colors & Fonts

To change colors or fonts, open `index.html` and find the `<script> tailwind.config = { ... } </script>` section. You can edit the color codes and font families in there.
